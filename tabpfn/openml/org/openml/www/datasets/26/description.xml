 3. Past Usage:
 
    The hierarchical decision model, from which this dataset is
    derived, was first presented in 
 
    M. Olave, V. Rajkovic, M. Bohanec: An application for admission in
    public school systems. In (I. Th. M. Snellen and W. B. H. J. van de
    Donk and J.-P. Baquiast, editors) Expert Systems in Public
    Administration, pages 145-160. Elsevier Science Publishers (North
    Holland)}, 1989.
 
    Within machine-learning, this dataset was used for the evaluation
    of HINT (Hierarchy INduction Tool), which was proved to be able to
    completely reconstruct the original hierarchical model. This,
    together with a comparison with C4.5, is presented in
 
    B. Zupan, M. Bohanec, I. Bratko, J. Demsar: Machine learning by
    function decomposition. ICML-97, Nashville, TN. 1997 (to appear)
 
 4. Relevant Information Paragraph:
 
    Nursery Database was derived from a hierarchical decision model
    originally developed to rank applications for nursery schools. It
    was used during several years in 1980's when there was excessive
    enrollment to these schools in Ljubljana, Slovenia, and the
    rejected applications frequently needed an objective
    explanation. The final decision depended on three subproblems:
    occupation of parents and child's nursery, family structure and
    financial standing, and social and health picture of the family.
    The model was developed within expert system shell for decision
    making DEX (M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision
    making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.).
 
    The hierarchical model ranks nursery-school applications according
    to the following concept structure:
 
    NURSERY            Evaluation of applications for nursery schools
    . EMPLOY           Employment of parents and child's nursery
    . . parents        Parents' occupation
    . . has_nurs       Child's nursery
    . STRUCT_FINAN     Family structure and financial standings
    . . STRUCTURE      Family structure
    . . . form         Form of the family
    . . . children     Number of children
    . . housing        Housing conditions
    . . finance        Financial standing of the family
    . SOC_HEALTH       Social and health picture of the family
    . . social         Social conditions
    . . health         Health conditions
 
    Input attributes are printed in lowercase. Besides the target
    concept (NURSERY) the model includes four intermediate concepts:
    EMPLOY, STRUCT_FINAN, STRUCTURE, SOC_HEALTH. Every concept is in
    the original model related to its lower level descendants by a set
    of examples (for these examples sets see 
    http://www-ai.ijs.si/BlazZupan/nursery.html).
 
    The Nursery Database contains examples with the structural
    information removed, i.e., directly relates NURSERY to the eight input
    attributes: parents, has_nurs, form, children, housing, finance,
    social, health.
 
    Because of known underlying concept structure, this database may be
    particularly useful for testing constructive induction and
    structure discovery methods.
