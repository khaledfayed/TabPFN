Competition 1 (preprocessed data)
A straight-forward classification task. We provide pre-computed feature vectors for each word in the eye movement trajectory, with class labels.

The dataset consist of several assignments. Each assignment consists of a question followed by ten sentences (titles of news articles). One of the sentences is the correct answer to the question (C) and five of the sentences are irrelevant to the question (I). Four of the sentences are relevant to the question (R), but they do not answer it.


* Features are in columns, feature vectors in rows.
* Each assignment is a time sequence of 22-dimensional feature vectors.
* The first column is the line number, second the assignment number and the next 22 columns (3 to 24) are the different features. Columns 25 to 27 contain extra information about the example. The training data set contains the classification label in the 28th column: &quot;0&quot; for irrelevant, &quot;1&quot; for relevant and &quot;2&quot; for the correct answer.
* Each example (row) represents a single word. You are asked to return the classification of each read sentence.
* The 22 features provided are commonly used in psychological studies on eye movement. All of them are not necessarily relevant in this context.

The objective of the Challenge is to predict the classification labels (I, R, C).
